    <h1><b>QUE:16</b>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript ?</h1> 
    <p>-> In JavaScript, you can force a page to load another page by changing the window.location object's href property to the URL of the page you want to load. This is commonly done when you want to perform client-side redirection to a different webpage. </p>
