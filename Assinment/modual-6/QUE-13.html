    <h1><b>QUE:13</b>What is the function of the delete operator ?</h1>
    <p>-> The delete operator in JavaScript is used to remove a property from an object or to delete an element from an array.</p> <br><br>
</section>
<b>EXAMPLE:</b> <br><br>
<script>
    var a=[10,"hloww",20,"heyy","hiee",10]
    delete a[0];
    document.write(a)
</script> <br><br>
<p> -> Deleting an element from an array using delete leaves a gap in the array, resulting in an undefined value at the deleted index. </p>
